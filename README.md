# tv-show

This assessment is meant for ABN to review my developer skills for the frontend position.

 

In this project I decided to go out of my comfort zone and start working with Vuejs v3, as I am coming from Reactjs/Nextjs based developmentx§.

I have use some of the same working structure. For the Pages folder as in React/Next I use the Views folders and for the components I use the same structure.

In my opinion using a tool like VUEX can be a little overkill so I decided to use the composition function like the useHooks as in Reactjs.

The composition functions are more like straight up JavaScript functions. These functions I use to call fetch api and return more information about data loading and error. 

As for the style I use a new tool name Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first style library that gives programmer and designers a better user experience.

I could have chosen another CSS framework but by choosing this utility library, I can show that I am someone who likes keeping ahead of new technologies.

As I am new to Vue testing I decided to make some easy testing as a good learning curve so I can enter little by little into TDD later on.

## Introduction
The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate candidate’s familiarity with frontend technologies, programming patterns and to showcase a sample of what clean and reusable code means to the candidate. This is also helps in understanding candidate’s basic design knowledge.

## Notes
- Use any frameworks of your choice
- Application must be responsive and mobile friendly
- Please keep it to a minimum in leveraging/using scaffolding tools/boilerplate templates/plugins. We don’t expect you to create things from scratch but, we also would like to see your own creation
- Please create a readme file that explains your architectural decisions (E.G. why did you choose a specific framework) and make sure you include instructions on how to run your solution
- Please make surethat UI is simple yet eye-catching
- Please include unit tests
- Please feel free to include more features other than a few mentioned below

## Requirements
You will use an openTV shows API http://www.tvmaze.com/apito create an application that allows users to view a few lists(preferable horizontal list) of TV shows based on different genres (drama, comedy, sports, etc.).

Your goal is to display a few popular TV shows based on their rating and genre on a dashboard and when the user clicks on a TV show then the details of that TV show should be displayed on another screen. Also, the user should be able to search for a TV show to get the details. You can design your own UI which fits this requirement

## Architecture
There is no limit for this. Design your application as you wish. But make sure you will focus on clean code, reusability, frontend beast practices. Show us that you know how to produce top notch applications.
